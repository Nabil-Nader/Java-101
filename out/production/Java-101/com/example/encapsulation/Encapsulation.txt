Encapsulation

OOP programming principle

Bind state and behavior together into a single unit

Combine data and code acting on that data.

-Java classes allow us to bind together data nad related functionality.

we can implement parts of the encapsulation principle, In Java with classes.

Benefits Of encapsulation
    prevent classes from becoming tightly coupled
    Easily modify the inner working od one class without,affecting the rest of the program


Everything can't have direct access[requires restriction]
    make a class's attributes hidden from other classes, using encapsulation.

    provide a clear interface through public methods.


In java, we can achieve  encapsulation by using access modifiers.

Access Modifier
    allows you to determine programmatically, where certain variable and method can be accessed in your code


Private:only visible in the class.

No modifier : visible in the package it lives in.

protected:visible to package and all subclasses.

public:everywhere


Main method is a public it invokes my JVM

one common class that use encapsulation is String Class
