Mastering abstraction for technical interviews

Abstraction
    to hide implementation complexity so we can achieve generalization.

    abstract class is like a template for class
    where some functionality is not implemented yet
    you can not instantiate directly, but other classes can extend and implement
    the appropriate functionality
