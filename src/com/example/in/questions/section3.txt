Concatenate strings with different methods

    in Concatenation, we create a new string, leaving the old strings
    unaltered.



Access data from strings
    CharAt();



String class in Java does not have reverse() method, however,
 the StringBuilder class has built-in reverse() method.


 StringBuilder class do not have toCharArray() method,
  while String class does have toCharArray() method.




  Converting String into Bytes: getBytes() method is used to convert the input string
   into bytes[].
  Method:

  1. Create a temporary byte[]  of length equal
     to the length of the input string.
  2. Store the bytes (which we get by using
     getBytes() method) in reverse order into
     the temporary byte[] .
  3. Create a new String abject using byte[] to
     store result.

      result[i] = strAsByteArray[strAsByteArray.length - i - 1];


Apply string functions in technical interviews
    How many sentences does it have ?
    How many worlds, How many characters.....

    period + space + ?

    we can use String Split function to implement this
    Split take a regular expression and break  a String, around a matches of that expression.


    String [] newText = text.split("\\. ");
    //we did use double backslash,because we want to use literal dot character
    // rather what the dot mean in regular expression

    //to figure out the number of sentence we would grab the length of the array


    A palindrome is a word or phrase that read the same backward as it does forward

    input a string -> output a boolean
