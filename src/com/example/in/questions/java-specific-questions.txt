JVM -> compile once run anywhere
    Java was designed so application can be executed on any platform
    [run on any machine that supported Java]
    that supports java without having to be recompiled.


When Java compiled it is compiled into java bytecode, JVM run this bytecode.
JVM has an abstract that can be mapped to any platform.


JRE ->[what you need to run java program ]
    contains the JVM, as well as  browser plug-ins for executing java applets.
    without JRE you can not run java programs.

The JVM lives in the JRE because the JRE allows you to run Java programs on your computer.




JDK-> [ what you need to develop java programs ]
    is a full-featured software development kit for Java,
    include JRE, as well as compilers,debuggers and tools to create programs
    without JDK,you can not build java programs


Classes , Instances, and constructors

    Classes are the blueprints we use in order to represent objects in code and defined their properties and functionality.
        Attributes
        Behavior

        each class will have a different value in the attributes
        but will use the same methods



What's the difference between static and non-static methods?

Static Method:
    is a class method,and belong to the class itself
    do not need an instance to use it.


Non-Static method:
    is a instance of the method,belong to each object that generated from the class


IF you want to use a method without creating an instance of class, static methods are the way to go

if your method is related to an instance's attributes, it should be non-static



How is scope used in Java?
    Parameters pass data to a function and they only live inside that given function.

    Local variable lives inside the method


How do you access modifiers restrict scope?
