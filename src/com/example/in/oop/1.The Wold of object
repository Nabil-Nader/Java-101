all Java Interivwe you proprelly asked this question
what is an object?
it is like a capsule,contains data and behavior
Object are instances of class -> and a class like template from which objects are created

Object is a combination of 2 things
    -state of object stored as member variables

    -set of method that give object ability to perform certain tasks

What is encapsulation?

    as software engineers we like to encapsulate objects

    the thing we want to encapsulate -> are data and methods
    that related to a single concept.

    there is 2 thing we wish to achieve through encapsulation

    1-restrict access to private data[that's information specific to that class],
    like how the internal working of the class,would be showing to outside world

    2-we want to use encapsulation to clump data and functionality together,we want to keep object self-suffusion
    and independent of each other


encapsulation refers simply to bundling the data,with the operations on that data.
So you have a class encapsulating data - fields - along with the methods for manipulating that data.

one of the points of bundling data and methods is to hide the implementation.

before go into Design pattern, we need to understand

-interfaces
-inheritance
-polymorphism
