How to: Work at Google — Example Coding/Engineering Interview

input -> [1,2,3,9] sum = 8 => No
input ->[1,2,4,4] sum = 8 => yes

if you user 2 for loop it will be O(n^2) it works but we will stuck with time consuming
keep in mind that tha number are sorted, so we can do Binary Search 1 +7 =8, 2+6 =8 and so on
this will be Θ(log(n)) [  according to video it is a good answer but it is a kind of slow]
in binary search we had to scan all element

but we will do it as liner Θ(1)
if first element + last element = given number [we find a match]
    if it is bigger we will leave last element and go for the decrease by one
    if it is smaller than given we will leave the first element and increase by one


since array has a constant time in getting one element Θ(1)

while (lower < higher )


if data is not sorted we need a better approach
we will use another DS for look up like HasTable => it also has a constant time for look up
